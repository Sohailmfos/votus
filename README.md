# An Online Voting System for University.

Download the project and after uunzipping.

database admin username- admin.

database password- admin.


directly import poll.sql to the database section it will automatically create the all database tables and you only need to run the apache server using any of these i.e like WAMP for windows or XAMPP for windows and linux as well or LAMP for linux. 

The backend is designed using PHP with no framework.

In upcoming days you will find codeIgniter as PHP framework.
